# Mikrokosmos
Kosmo format version of Music Thing Modular's Mikrophonie Eurorack synthesizer module (https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Mikrophonie). Almost no change to the circuit (other than the diodes protecting the power supply), but PCB is laid out differently and there is a Kosmo-size front panel inspired by the Eurorack original.
